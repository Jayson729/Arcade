# Introduction
 
We are going to create classic arcade games. We plan on making them selectable from a main menu. The games in our arcade are going to consist of pong, Pacman, Donkey Kong, and Frogger. If we have time we might add some more games. 
 
The main menu for our game will have volume settings, resolution settings, and control settings. Along with this we will have pictures to represent the games and a scoreboard for all of the games we have in our arcade. We expect there to be a lot of issues while we are building our arcade, since all of the people creating this project are going to be learning Python while trying to make multiple games and a gui. 
 
# Anticipated Technologies
 
We plan on using Python
We’ll probably be using the Pygame library to make our game
Build AI for pong and pacman
 
# Method/Approach
 
First we have to learn more python and the pygame library. To do this we’ll watch tutorials, then we’ll make pong as our first game to introduce us to making games. From there we’ll make more complex games as we learn more. We’ll build unit tests for functions as we make them, and add GUI for them. We will save the scores achieved to a file so that they can be reopened on launch, or even reset.
 
# Estimated Timeline
 
Week 1 – Introduce ourselves to pygame and python

Week 2 – Make pong

Week 3 – Make pacman engine

Week 4 – Testing and AI for ghosts

Weeks 5 + 6 – Donkey kong

Weeks 7 + 8 – Frogger

Extra weeks – fixing bugs, polishing games, home screen, settings page, sound/music, graphics, etc.
 
# Anticipated Problems
 
We all are beginners at Python, so our first obstacle will be needing to learn Python.
Make sure games are optimized to run well
Making sure no game code conflicts with another game's code.
Making it work on everyone’s computer.
Get everything to work on time, for both meetings and the final product.
Making sure we have enough time to meet up as a group.
